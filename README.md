<h1 align="center">WearSani - Genuine Quality Pashmina Scarves and Blankets</h1>

[View the live project here](https://pp5-wearsani.herokuapp.com/)

The WearSani project is a B2C e-commerce application which sells Pashmina scarves and blankets to end customers.  The site aims to present users with an attractive and intuitive online shopping experience and encourage return visits through features such as discounts, a newsletter, social media posts, and an easy to use user profile function to save customer details.

The site is implemented as a retail store where users can view, search and filter the products on offer, then select items to add to their shopping cart and purchase through a secure single payment.

General users can view details of the products available for purchase and can sign up to the company newletter. In addition, registered users can create a wishlist of products they may be interested in and a profile to keep track of delivery details and order history.

Admin users can manage the lists of products that they sell, this includes being able to add new product to the range, update pricing. A full description of the available functionality is included in this document.

The Web Marketing strategies used by the project are :
- Organic Social - through facebook
- Email - through a newletter subscription managed via Mailchimp

The structure and purpose of the WearSani project is based on the Code Institute Boutique Ado walkthrough example application.

## Planning

A GitHub Project with linked Issues was used as the Agile tool for this project.  User Stories with acceptance criteria were defined using GitHub Issues and development of code for these stories was managed using a Kanban board.  All of the User Stories were linked to 'parent' Epic issues to show how they all supported the over-arching goals of the project.

The Epic, User Stories and Kanban board can be accessed here : [WearSani Agile Tool]<!-- (Link to project of github) -->

## Deployment 

Detailed below are instructions on how to clone this project repository and the steps to configure and deploy the application.  

1. How to Clone the Repository
2. Create Application and Postgres DB on Heroku
3. Connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository 
4. Configure Amazon Web Services S3 to store static files and images
5. Configure STRIPE config vars and webhooks


<details>
<summary>How to Clone the Repository</summary>

- Go to the https://github.com/nofursad/pp5-wearsani.git repository on GitHub 
- Click the "Code" button to the right of the screen, click HTTPs and copy the link there
- Open a GitBash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to locate the clone
- On the command line, type "git clone" then paste in the copied url and press the Enter key to begin the clone process
- To install the packages required by the application use the command : pip install -r requirements.txt
- When developing and running the application locally set DEBUG=True in the settings.py file
- Changes made to the local clone can be pushed back to the repository using the following commands :

  - git add *filenames*  (or "." to add all changed files)
  - git commit -m *"text message describing changes"*
  - git push

- N.B. Any changes pushed to the master branch will take effect on the live project once the application is re-deployed from Heroku
- N.B. Be careful not to upload DEBUG=True in the settings.py file to GitHub - this setting should only be used locally.

<details>
<summary>Configure Amazon Web Services S3 to store static files and images</summary>

- Log on to AWS account on aws.amazon.com - create an account if necessary
- From the dashboard access the S3 services
- Create a new 'bucket', it is recommended to give this a name similar to your application to make it easy to remember and use, choose a region close to you, uncheck "Block all public access" and acknowledge that the bucket will be public.  Next, click on the new bucket to configure it.
- Go to the properties tab and turn on static website hosting, fill in default values for index and error document settings - e.g. index.html and error.html and click on Save.
- Go to the permissions tab and make 3 changes to configure the bucket :

    - Step 1 Configure CORS : 
        - Paste the following CORS configuration string : <br>
    	[ { "AllowedHeaders": ["Authorization"],<br>
                "AllowedMethods": ["GET"],<br>
                "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],<br>
                "ExposeHeaders": [] } ]<br>

    - Step 2 Generate Policy:
        - Go to the bucket policy area, click on Edit and click on policy generator.  
        - Choose S3 bucket policy from drop-down
	    - Put asterisk in Principal field
	    - Select get object from Actions drop-down
	    - Copy ARN and paste into ARN box on the policy generator page
	    - Click Add Statement
	    - Click Generate Policy then copy the policy into the policy editor window
        - Add /* to the end of the Resource key
	    - Click Save

    - Step 3 ACL :
        - Go to the Access Control List area
		- Set the list objects permission for everyone under the Public Access section and
		check the box to confirm you want this permission setting

- Create a user to access the bucket through IAM as follows :
    - Return to the services menu on the dashboard and access the IAM area
    - Create a group
    - On the same page click on Policies, then Create Policy, go to JSON table and select Import Managed Policy
    - Click on Import managed policy on rhs
	- Search for S3 and select AmazonS3FullAccess and click on Import
	- Go back and get the Bucket Policy ARN (generated when bucket was created)
	- Change the Resource value from * to ARN bucket and its contents - e.g : <br>
        "Resource": [<br>
                    "arn:aws:s3:::pp5-wearsani",  (sensitive)<br>
                    "arn:aws:s3:::pp5-wearsani/*"<br>
                ]<br>
	- Click Next and then Review Policy
	- Give the policy a name and click Create Policy
    - Attach the policy to the group you created as follows : Go to groups, click on your group, go to the Permissions tab, click Add permissions and select Attach policies, select the policy created on previous step and click Attach permissions
    - Create user to put into the group. Click Users on lhs, click Add User, assign name check the programmatic access checkbox, click on Next:Permissions.  Add user to group, click through to the end and click Create User.

- Download and save the generated csv which contains the users access and secret access keys
- Update the AWS section of the settings.py file - replace the bucket name and region with the values you set up in the previous steps :

			if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
				# Bucket Config
				AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'pp5-wearsani'    <------ bucket name and region
				AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-1'
				AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
				AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')

- Add the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY config vars to heroku using the values from the downloaded cvs
- Add USE_AWS = True to the Heroku config vars
- Remove the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC config var at this point from Heroku
- The custom_storages.py file that is part of this project will tell Django to use S3 to store static and media files when collectstatic is run
- The remaining AWS configuration settings needed are already configured in this projects settings.py file
- Go to the S3 dashboard and create a folder called media in the new bucket.  Specify grant public-read access on the folder and tick the checkbox to confirm.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Configure STRIPE config vars and webhooks</summary>

- Log in to your Stripe account - create one if necessary
- Add STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY and STRIPE_SECRET_KEY to the Heroku config vars, assign these variables values from your Stripe account dashboard
- Create a webhook endpoint for use with your applications.  On the stripe dashboard go to the Developers -> Webhooks area, click add endpoint, use the url of your Heroku application with '/checkout/wh/' tagged onto the end of the url string.  When configuring the endpoint, the events to register to listen to are payment_intent_succeeded and payment_intent_failed
- Once the endpoint is set up get the signing secret for the webhooks and save this value as a Heroku config var called STRIPE_WH_SECRET.
