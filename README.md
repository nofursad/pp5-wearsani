[View the live project here](https://pf5-iomha-prints.herokuapp.com/)

The WearSani project is a B2C e-commerce application which sells Pashmina scarves and blankets to end customers.  The site aims to present users with an attractive and intuitive online shopping experience and encourage return visits through features such as discounts, a newsletter, social media posts, and an easy to use user profile function to save customer details.

The site is implemented as a retail store where users can view, search and filter the products on offer, then select items to add to their shopping cart and purchase through a secure single payment.

General users can view details of the products available for purchase and can sign up to the company newletter. In addition, registered users can create a wishlist of products they may be interested in and a profile to keep track of delivery details and order history.

Admin users can manage the lists of products that they sell, this includes being able to add new product to the range, update pricing. A full description of the available functionality is included in this document.

The Web Marketing strategies used by the project are :
- Organic Social - through facebook
- Email - through a newletter subscription managed via Mailchimp

The structure and purpose of the WearSani project is based on the Code Institute Boutique Ado walkthrough example application.
